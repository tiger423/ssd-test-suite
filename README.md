Replace your_username with the actual username you want to grant privileges to. 

The -a flag ensures that the user is added to the sudo group without removing them from any other groups, and -G specifies the group

After adding the user to the sudo group, they can execute commands with root privileges by preceding them with sudo. For example:


# Create virtual environment

python3 -m venv ssd_env

source ssd_env/bin/activate

# Install packages in venv

pip install psutil pandas

# Run with venv python (deactivate first)

deactivate

sudo ssd_env/bin/python ssd_test_suite.py





FUNCTIONS THAT COULD WORK WITHOUT ROOT

These functions could work in "read-only" mode:

collect_system_info() - Lines 109-150 (CPU, memory info)

collect_pcie_info() - Line 219 (lspci works without root)

System monitoring and CSV logging

RECOMMENDED APPROACH

For Testing:

bash

# Option 1: Quick system-wide install

sudo pip3 install psutil pandas

sudo python3 ssd_test_suite.py

# Option 2: If you have conda/virtual environments

sudo /path/to/your/python ssd_test_suite.py

For Production:

bash

# Create dedicated environment

python3 -m venv /opt/ssd_test

sudo /opt/ssd_test/bin/pip install psutil pandas

sudo /opt/ssd_test/bin/python /path/to/ssd_test_suite.py

VERIFY PACKAGE INSTALLATION

bash

# Check if packages are visible to sudo

sudo python3 -c "import psutil, pandas; print('Packages available')"


# Run sudo without password

From the sudoers manual:

When multiple entries match for a user, they are applied in order. Where there are multiple matches, the last match is used (which is not necessarily the most specific match).

If you want that username does not enter the password each time he does a sudo and he is already a member of sudo, the entry in sudoers must be after the %sudo entry.

Correct
# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo     ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
username  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
